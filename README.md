# MIPS Assembly Platform Game

Welcome to my CSCB58 Winter 2022 MIPS assembly platform game project!

## Game Features

- **Classic Platformer Gameplay**: Control your character through diverse levels by jumping.
  
- **Heart Levels**: Your character has 3 hearts. Fire reduces one heart, and eating a bad bone fish also decreases your heart count.
  
- **Item Collection**: Explore the levels to collect items that enhance your abilities and aid in completing objectives.

- **Objective**: Successfully navigate each level to meet the Flower Cat at the end and advance to the next stage.

- **Obstacles and Challenges**: Watch out for obstacles, avoid falling into water to stay alive, and strategically plan your moves to overcome the game's challenges.
